                <p>As the 2026 Year of the Horse Spring Festival approached, ABC Chemical Co., Ltd. organized a series
                    of heartwarming Chinese New Year activities. These events were designed to foster a warm and
                    harmonious festive atmosphere, allowing every employee to feel the company's sincere care and the
                    warmth of being part of one big family.</p>

                <p>Prior to the festival, the company prepared practical and auspiciously symbolic Spring Festival gift
                    packages for all employees. The distribution was carried out in an orderly manner, with employees
                    beaming with smiles. A long-serving employee shared: "The company's welfare benefits make us feel
                    our value and appreciation."</p>

                    featuring an array of carefully prepared dishes. The spread brought colleagues together in a spirit
                    of warmth and togetherness, making the holiday season even more enjoyable and festive.</p>

                    personally led a team to visit various factory areas and workshops, extending sincere greetings to
                    frontline workers. The employees remained committed to their posts during the holiday. The
                    leadership repeatedly reminded workers to arrange their work and rest schedules appropriately and to
                    always ensure safe production.</p>
