# Modern Sales Map Update Complete

The Global Sales Map section has been successfully updated to a modern, light-themed design.

## Key Updates

### 1. Visual Theme
*   **Background**: Changed from dark blue gradient to clean light gray (`bg-gray-50`).
*   **Map Style**: Updated the interactive globe canvas to match the light background (`#F9FAFB`) with subtle gray continent dots (`#B0B0B0`).
*   **Accents**: Implemented a vibrant **Orange** color scheme (`#FF8C42`, `#FF6B35`) for map markers and UI elements to create a modern, energetic look.

### 2. UI Components
*   **Stat Cards**: Replaced the old "glassmorphism" cards with modern, clean white cards (`.stat-card`).
*   **Typography**: Updated text colors to dark gray (`#111827`) for optimal readability on the light background.
*   **Interactivity**: Added hover effects to cards that trigger orange gradients and icon highlights.

### 3. Code Cleanup
*   **CSS**: Removed unused legacy styles (`.kpi-glass-card`, etc.) to keep the stylesheet clean.
*   **HTML**: Simplified the section structure, removing complex SVG background patterns in favor of a clean, minimal look.

## Files Modified
*   `index.html`: Updated section structure and classes.
*   `style.css`: Added orange theme styles, removed legacy code.
*   `js/globe.js`: Updated canvas colors to match the new theme.

The website now features a modern, professional sales map section that aligns with current design trends.
