# Deployment Log - 2025-11-21

## Changes
- Removed duplicated "About Us" content from `about-us.html`.
- Specifically, removed the header image block which contained a visual duplication of the text content found in the main section.
- **Update**: Restored the header image section using a newly generated clean landscape image (`assets/images/about-header-clean.png`) without the text overlay, as per user request.

## Verification
- Checked `about-us.html` to ensure the header image div is removed.
- Verified that the main "About Us" text content remains intact under the "About Us" heading.
- **Update**: Verified `about-us.html` now includes the new clean image.

## Status
- [x] Changes applied
- [x] Committed and Pushed to main branch
