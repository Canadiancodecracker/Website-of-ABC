# Hero Banner Deployment - Final Confirmation

## Deployment Status: SUCCESS

### Summary of Changes
1.  **Hero Banner Integration**:
    - Added a full-width slideshow section to `index.html` immediately below the navigation bar.
    - Implemented automatic 5-second transitions between slides using JavaScript (`main.js`).

2.  **Visual Refinements**:
    - **Cropped "Science" Banner**: Removed the redundant white header/logo bar from `hero-banner-science.jpg` to prevent visual duplication with the main navigation bar.
    - **Cache Busting**: Appended `?v=2` to image URLs to ensure all users (and you) see the updated, cropped images immediately.

3.  **Codebase Status**:
    - All changes are committed to the `main` branch.
    - The repository is fully synced with GitHub (`origin/main`).
    - No uncommitted files remain.

### Verification
- The slideshow is active and looping correctly.
- The "Science" slide no longer displays the duplicate "ABC Chemical" logo.
- The layout is responsive and positioned correctly.

**The feature is fully deployed and live.**
